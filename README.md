# Data Exfiltration from PIP'd Employee

## Overview

The project illustrates a threat hunting investigation focused on a potential unauthorised data exfiltration attempt by a threat from within the organisation. After ruling out external threats, the investigation shifted focus to potentially compromised insiders ‚Äî those who may have fallen victim to social engineering, credential theft, or malware infection ‚Äî as well as disgruntled employees motivated by revenge. The primary tool used was **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)**, while leveraging Kusto Query Language (KQL) to query detailed threat hunting logs to identify indicators of unauthorised data exfiltration. The findings showcase the importance of continuous monitoring and proactive threat hunting to mitigate insider risks and safeguard sensitive organizational data.

## 1. Preparation

### Goal:
Set up the hunt by defining what you're looking for.

### Scenario:

An employee named John Doe, working in a sensitive department, recently got put on a performance improvement plan (PIP). After John threw a fit, management has raised concerns that John may be planning to steal proprietary information and then quit the company. 

### Hypothesis:

John is an administrator on his corporate device with unrestricted access to applications. After his recent placement in the Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), he may try to archive/compress sensitive information and transfer it to an external location for exfiltration.

## 2. Data Collection

### Goal:
Gather relevant data from logs, network traffic, and endpoints.

### Action:
Searched the following Microsoft Defender for Endpoint tables:

- `DeviceFileEvents`
- `DeviceProcessEvents`
- `DeviceNetworkEvents`

#### Initial Findings:
Located multiple instances of ZIP file creation and movement to a `backup` directory.

```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| where DeviceName == ""
| where FileName contains "zip"
| sort by Timestamp desc
```

## üìä 3. Data Analysis

### üéØ Goal
Analyze data to test your hypothesis.

### Findings
- Used a specific ZIP file creation timestamp to investigate surrounding events.

### Observed
- PowerShell silently installed 7-Zip.
- 7-Zip was used to archive employee data.

```kql
let VMName = "";
let specificTime = datetime(2025-04-09T22:17:16.6780857Z);
DeviceProcessEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == VMName
| order by Timestamp desc
```

### Exfiltration Check

No signs of external data transfer found in `DeviceNetworkEvents`.

```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| where Timestamp between ((specificTime - 2m) .. (specificTime + 2m))
| where DeviceName == ""
| order by Timestamp desc
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 4. Investigation

### üéØ Goal
Investigate any suspicious findings.

### MITRE ATT&CK TTPs

| Tactic          | Technique                  | Description                                               |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Execution       | PowerShell (T1086)         | Used to silently install and execute 7-Zip                |
| Persistence     | Scheduled Task/Job (T1053) | Potential persistence vector for automated archiving      |
| Defense Evasion | Masquerading (T1036)       | Use of 7-Zip may mask malicious intent                    |
| Collection      | Data Staged (T1074)        | Data prepared in ZIP archive potentially for exfiltration |

## üö® 5. Response

### üéØ Goal  
Mitigate any confirmed threats.

### Actions Taken
- All findings were escalated to John‚Äôs manager for HR handling.  
- No evidence of data exfiltration was found.  
- Recommended monitoring of John‚Äôs device for further activity.

## üìù 6. Documentation

### üéØ Goal  
Record your findings and learn from them.

### üìö What was Documented
- Query logs with timestamps  
- Observed file and process behavior  
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping  
- Management escalation actions

---

## üîÑ 7. Improvement

### üéØ Goal  
Improve your security posture or refine your methods.

### Prevention Recommendations:
- **PowerShell Logging & Restrictions**: Enable Script Block and Module Logging, and apply Constrained Language Mode.  
- **Least Privilege**: Restrict unnecessary admin rights and software installation privileges.  
- **Application Whitelisting**: Prevent unauthorized tools like 7-Zip from being silently installed.  
- **Behavioral Alerts**: Create alerts for:
  - PowerShell installing programs
  - Mass ZIP file creation
  - Admin user archiving sensitive files

### ‚öôÔ∏è Hunting Process Enhancements:
- Automate correlation between `DeviceFileEvents` and `DeviceProcessEvents`
- Add scheduled process hunting based on timestamp-based anomalies
- Improve user behavior baselining (e.g., who normally uses 7-Zip?)

## üìå Summary

This investigation highlights how behavioral analysis and endpoint telemetry can uncover early signs of insider threats. Even without confirmed exfiltration, the act of staging data for compression on a sensitive employee‚Äôs device warrants serious scrutiny.
